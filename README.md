# Tutorial Git Setup
The purpose of this repo is the help familiarize myself with Git, as well as [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub")
My first contribution is this bit of explanation. My hope is to be thorough with my documentaiton throughout this process.
I will eventually try to come back and add to this, when I decide that it is worthwhile.
Feel free to suggest anything you can think of, on any of my public projects. I would love to hear your feedback throughout this process.

## First File Creation Success:
Everything worked as planned! I was able to create my very first file & repository with version control on GitHub. Many thanks to the following [markdown-editor](https://markdown-editor.github.io/# "markdown-editor") tool.

## Changing Name of Repo to Reflect Content:
I set the name of the repo to "first-git-setup" rather than "tutorial-git-setup", this change was due to the fact that this is not a tutorial for others.
I also thought it would be a great time to make sure I could rename a repo, and reconnect the repo to my computer with the new name included.

## Switching to Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for My Text Editor
I have made the swap from the great [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "Notepad++") over to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Visual Studio Code") based on the recomendations made in the "Text Editors" lesson of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com "The Odin Project")
While it is not crucial to use Visual Studio Code, I thought I would try and do everything by the book, until I found something I could then prove to be better. For now, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Visual Studio Code") should work well for starting out.

## First Line of Git Commit Message Serves as Git Commit Title
I was curious on if I should be adding a new line after the title of the commit, and I made this change to see. Unfortunately, it did not work the way I was anticipating, and so I decided to install the following extension [Commit Message Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adam-bender.commit-message-editor "Commit Message Editor") to try and commit again with a title seperate from the body text of the commit.
I am not sure if this is the best practice, but I felt that a short title with a longer body text would be the best format, and I did not want the title to run on with "..." AKA elipses and continue/spill into the body.
