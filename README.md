# Tutorial Git Setup
The purpose of this repo is the help familiarize myself with Git, as well as GitHub
My first contribution is this bit of explanation. My hope is to be thorough with my documentaiton throughout this process.
I will eventually try to come back and add to this, when I decide that it is worthwhile.
Feel free to suggest anything you can think of, on any of my public projects. I would love to hear your feedback throughout this process.

## Edit:
Everything worked as planned! I was able to create my very first file & repository with version control on GitHub. Many thanks to the following [markdown-editor](https://markdown-editor.github.io/# "markdown-editor") tool.
